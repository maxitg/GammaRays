Corrections:

Section 2.1, line 25: the in "the gtselect" should be typeset in an ordinary font, and not monospace

Equation (6): There is an obvious typesetting problem. \eta should have 3 arguments, separated by commas. There should be no multiplication sign before \theta, and the parenthesis after \eta, and after its last argument should have matching size.

Page 14, second code listing: There should be no space between equal signs in "LAT_CONFIG == 1"

Questions:

Q1. Yes
Q2. Yes
Q3. Yes
Q4. Yes
Q5. Yes
Q6. Yes
Q7. No, the correct synonim for "do" here is compute, not represent.
Q8. No, it should be singular. The bands we are talking about here are the same as defined in the abstract: 100 MeV < E < 1 GeV and E > 1 GeV
Q9. The reference "Vianello, G. 2012, eConf, C121028, 325" is correct as can be seen on inSPIRE HEP: https://inspirehep.net/search?p=find+eprint+1304.5570, however, for clarity, please change it to: "Vianello, G. 2012, eConf, C121028, 325, arXiv:1304.5570"
