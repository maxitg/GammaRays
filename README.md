Spectral Lags in Very High Energy Emission of Gamma Ray Bursts
=========

The spectral lags between two GRB emission bands: 100 MeV - 1 GeV; and 1 GeV - 300 GeV are studied. The stretching of higher energy emission is confirmed for GRB090926A with a statistical significance of 3.4 sigma, >GeV signal has longer duration. A simple geometrical model is proposed to explain this result.
